/*
Well, that was easy. Isn’t it? Now we’ll go one step further and do the sum of elements of an array.

Write a program to print the sum of all the elements of an array of size 4.

Instructions:

We have defined an integer array numArray[4] for you.
We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
You have to write the logic to add the elements.
Print the sum.
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main(void) {
	
	int numArray[4];   // Define an array of four integers
        int i;
	// Get inputs for the array elements
	for (i=0; i<4; i++) {
    	cin >> numArray[i];
	}
    
	int sum = 0;
	// Write the logic to add these integers here:
 
    for (i=0; i<4; i++) {
    	sum=sum + numArray[i];
	}
 
    
	cout << sum << endl;// Print the sum
    
	return 0;
}
